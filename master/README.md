#vanGogh - express your code in color#
Why not let the legendary artist color your code? vanGogh is a small jQuery plugin that provides (client-side) syntax highlighting powered by the awesome [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) library.

##Usage##

Documentation is under way. Until then, take a look at the test case below. It's really not that hard to use!

###Test case###

See [test case on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pMZge/show/) to see vanGogh in action!

##Limitations##

The highlight.js styles are not supported. vanGogh have many more elements that need styling so you will have
to use vanGogh-specific styles.

##Licensing##
All code is open source and dual licensed under GPL and MIT. Check the individual licenses for more information.

##Credits##
Big creds to [isagalaev](https://github.com/isagalaev) and contributors for the creation of [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js); the heart and soul of this plugin.
