### express your code in color
Why not let the legendary artist color your code? vanGogh is a small jQuery plugin that provides (client-side) syntax highlighting powered by the awesome [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) library.

## Basic usage

	$("pre").vanGogh();

## Test case

Check out [test case on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pMZge/)

## Limitations

The [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) styles are not supported. vanGogh have many more elements that need styling so you will have
to use vanGogh-specific styles.
